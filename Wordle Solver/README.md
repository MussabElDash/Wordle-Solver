# Wordle Solver (iOS) 🟩🟨⬛️

A fast, data-driven Wordle companion that **narrows the solution space instantly** and recommends the **next best guess** using information theory and worst-case analysis. Built with **SwiftUI** and optimized with **offline precomputation** for near-instant suggestions even with large word lists.

---

## ✨ What the app provides

- **Best-next-guess recommendations** based on proven strategy metrics (entropy / expected remaining / minimax).
- **Instant candidate narrowing** after each round of feedback (gray/yellow/green).
- **Multiple solving modes** to match different play styles:
  - **Hybrid (default)**: balanced and strong overall
  - **Average (Entropy)**: fastest average progress
  - **Worst-case (Minimax)**: most consistent / safest
- **Hard Mode toggle** to restrict suggestions to guesses that satisfy known constraints.
- **History + Undo + Reset** to manage a full solving session.
- **Tap-to-fill and copy** a suggested guess for quick use.

## 🧠 Solver modes

### 1) Hybrid (Default) — “best of both worlds”
Optimizes for a strong average solve while avoiding bad worst-case outcomes:

1. **Minimize Expected Remaining (E)**  
2. Tie-break by **Worst Bucket (W)** (minimax)  
3. Prefer **candidate answers** (✓), then alphabetical  
4. (Optional heuristic) lower “waste” for non-hard-mode exploration

### 2) Average (Entropy)
Chooses guesses that maximize information gain on average by **maximizing entropy (H)**.

### 3) Worst-case (Minimax)
Chooses guesses that minimize the worst possible remaining search space by **minimizing W**.

## 📊 What the suggestion stats mean

Each suggestion includes:

- **H: Entropy** → **higher is better**  
  Measures expected information gained. A guess with high entropy splits the remaining candidates more evenly.

- **E: Expected Remaining** → **lower is better**  
  Expected number of candidates remaining after applying the feedback from this guess.

- **W: Worst Bucket** → **lower is better**  
  Worst-case number of candidates remaining (the largest feedback bucket for this guess).

- **✓ Candidate**  
  The guess is still a possible answer (not just a legal guess).

---

## ⚡ Performance approach

To keep the UI responsive and make recommendations fast, the app uses **precomputed feedback patterns**:

### Precomputed pattern table
A bundled binary file:

- `patterns.bin`
- Stores `pattern(guess, answer)` as a single byte (`UInt8`, values `0...242`)
- Lookup formula:
  - `patternTable[guessIndex * answersCount + answerIndex]`

This avoids recomputing Wordle feedback rules inside the hot loop.

### Why not precompute “best guess for every state”?
Because the number of possible candidate sets is astronomical (`2^N`).  
Instead, we precompute the reusable primitive (guess→answer feedback), which makes runtime scoring extremely fast.

---

## 📁 Data files (bundled)

These files are expected in the app bundle:

- `answers_clean.txt`  
  One 5-letter answer per line.

- `allowed_combined_sorted.txt`  
  All legal guesses (answers included), sorted and deduplicated.

- `patterns.bin`  
  The precomputed pattern table built using **exactly** the same ordering as the two files above.

- `openers.txt` *(optional but recommended)*  
  Pre-ranked “best opener” guesses for instant first-screen suggestions.

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: `patterns.bin` is only valid if `answers_clean.txt` and `allowed_combined_sorted.txt` match the **same ordering** used when generating it.

---

## 🛠️ Offline generation (recommended)

### Generate clean wordlists + patterns.bin
Use a script to produce:
- `answers_clean.txt`
- `allowed_combined_sorted.txt`
- `patterns.bin`

Example workflow:
1. Start from `answers.txt` + `allowed.txt`
2. Generate the canonical clean files and the binary table once
3. Bundle the outputs in Xcode

### Generate openers.txt
Precompute the top openers (Hybrid by default) to show suggestions instantly before the first guess is entered.

> You can generate separate opener lists per mode if desired:
- `openers_hybrid.txt`
- `openers_average.txt`
- `openers_worstcase.txt`

---

## 🚀 Build & Run

### Requirements
- Xcode (latest recommended)
- iOS device or simulator

### Steps
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Ensure bundle resources include:
   - `answers_clean.txt`
   - `allowed_combined_sorted.txt`
   - `patterns.bin`
   - `openers.txt` (optional)
3. Select a run destination and hit **Run**

---

## ✅ UX details

### Input validation
- Guess input is constrained to:
  - **A–Z only**
  - **max 5 characters**
- **Add Guess** is disabled unless:
  - the guess is exactly 5 letters
  - it exists in the allowed guess list

### Suggestions interaction
- Tap a suggestion to:
  - autofill the guess input
  - copy the guess to clipboard
  - provide haptic confirmation

---

## 🧩 Project structure (high level)

- `ContentView.swift`
  - UI layout (iPhone/iPad adaptive)
  - history tracking and user interactions
  - computing known constraints from past guesses
  - displaying suggestions and stats

- `WordleSolver.swift`
  - candidate filtering from feedback
  - scoring guesses using precomputed `patterns.bin`
  - strategy modes and sorting rules

---

## 🧪 Notes on correctness (duplicate letters)
The underlying pattern encoding matches Wordle logic:
- Greens are matched first
- Remaining letters are counted for yellows
- Encoded as base-3 digits across 5 positions (0..242)

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap (optional ideas)
- Mode-specific opener lists (Hybrid/Average/Worst-case)
- Persist game sessions & history across launches
- Candidate list screen with search/filter
- Optional “hard mode enforcement” rules like official Wordle
- Extra analytics (solve distribution, average guesses, etc.)
